This code sets up a Flask web application that reads data from a CSV file, processes it, stores it in a MongoDB database, and provides a REST API to retrieve the stored soccer team data.\\n\\n**Step 1: Import Required Libraries**\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\\n```\\n\\n- `pandas`: A library used for data manipulation and analysis, including reading CSV files.\\n- `pymongo`: A library used to interact with MongoDB.\\n- `Flask`: A micro web framework for building web applications in Python.\\n\\n**Step 2: Create a Flask App**\\n\\n```python\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n```\\n\\n- Creates a Flask web application instance named `app`.\\n\\n**Step 3: Read CSV Data**\\n\\n```python\\ndata = pd.read_csv(\\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/gavinr/usa-soccer@master/mls.csv\\")\\n```\\n\\n- Uses pandas to read the CSV data from the provided URL and stores it in the `data` variable.\\n\\n**Step 4: Select Desired Columns**\\n\\n```python\\nselected_columns = [\\n    \\"team\\", \\"city\\", \\"state\\", \\"latitude\\", \\"longitude\\",\\n    \\"stadium\\", \\"stadium_capacity\\", \\"founded\\", \\"joined\\",\\n    \\"head_coach\\", \\"url\\", \\"wikipedia_url\\", \\"logo_url\\"\\n]\\ndata = data[selected_columns]\\n```\\n\\n- Defines a list of column names that are desired from the CSV data.\\n- Filters the `data` DataFrame to keep only the columns listed in `selected_columns`.\\n\\n**Step 5: Convert Data to Dictionaries**\\n\\n```python\\nrecords = data.to_dict(orient=\\"records\\")\\n```\\n\\n- Converts the filtered `data` DataFrame into a list of dictionaries using the `to_dict` method with the `orient=\\"records\\"` argument.\\n\\n**Step 6: Connect to MongoDB**\\n\\n```python\\nclient = MongoClient(\\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\\")\\ndb = client[\\"soccer\\"]\\ncollection = db[\\"mls\\"]\\n```\\n\\n- Creates a MongoDB client that connects to a MongoDB server running on the default localhost address and port (`27017`).\\n- Defines a database named `soccer` and a collection named `mls` within that database.\\n\\n**Step 7: Insert Records into MongoDB**\\n\\n```python\\ncollection.insert_many(records)\\nprint(\\"Data inserted into MongoDB.\\")\\n```\\n\\n- Inserts the list of dictionaries (`records`) into the `mls` collection in the MongoDB database.\\n- Prints a message to indicate that the data insertion is complete.\\n\\n**Step 8: Define API Endpoint for Soccer Data**\\n\\n```python\\n@app.route(\'/api/soccer\')\\ndef get_soccer_data():\\n    soccer_data = list(collection.find({}))\\n    for item in soccer_data:\\n        item[\'_id\'] = str(item[\'_id\'])\\n    return jsonify(soccer_data)\\n```\\n\\n- Decorates a function to handle requests to the `/api/soccer` endpoint.\\n- Retrieves all documents from the `mls` collection and converts the MongoDB `_id` to a string format.\\n- Returns the soccer data as JSON response using the `jsonify` function.\\n\\n**Step 9: Run the Flask App**\\n\\n```python\\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\\n    app.run(debug=True)\\n```\\n\\n- Checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).\\n- Starts the Flask development server with the `debug` mode enabled.\\n\\n This code sets up a Flask web application to read soccer team data from a CSV file, store it in a MongoDB database, and provide a REST API to retrieve the data. It\'s a basic example and can be further customized and expanded for production use.\\n\\n\\n### Part 2: Building the React Frontend\\n\\n**Step 1: Set Up the React App**\\n\\nCreate a new React app and navigate to its directory:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-react-app soccer-visualization\\ncd soccer-visualization\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Install Bootstrap**\\n\\nInstall Bootstrap for styling:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install bootstrap axios\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3: Update the React UI**\\n\\nReplace the contents of `src/App.js` with the following code:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \\"react\\";\\nimport \\"./App.css\\";\\nimport axios from \\"axios\\";\\n\\nfunction App() {\\n  const [data, setData] = useState([]);\\n\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n

(error) {\\n      console.error(\\"Error fetching soccer data:\\", error);\\n    }\\n  };\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\"container mt-5\\">\\n      <h1 className=\\"mb-4\\">USA Soccer Team Data</h1>\\n      <div className=\\"row\\">\\n        {data.map((record, index) => (\\n          <div key={index} className=\\"col-md-4 mb-4\\">\\n            <div className=\\"card\\">\\n              <div className=\\"card-body\\">\\n                <h5 className=\\"card-title\\">{record.team}</h5>\\n                <p className=\\"card-text\\">{record.city}, {record.state}</p>\\n                <p className=\\"card-text\\">Stadium: {record.stadium}</p>\\n                <a href={record.wikipedia_url} className=\\"btn btn-primary\\">\\n                  Wikipedia\\n                </a>\\n              </div>\\n            </div>\\n          </div>\\n        ))}\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nexport default App;\\n```\\n This code is a React component written in JSX, which is used to create the user interface for our soccer team data visualization app. Let\'s break down the code step by step to understand what each part is doing:\\n\\n**Step 1: Import Required Libraries**\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \\"react\\";\\nimport \\"./App.css\\";\\nimport axios from \\"axios\\";\\n```\\n\\n- Imports React, which is the core library for building UI components.\\n- Imports `useState` and `useEffect` from the `react` module, which are React hooks for managing state and handling side effects, respectively.\\n- Imports the `App.css` file for styling the component.\\n- Imports `axios`, a library used for making HTTP requests.\\n\\n**Step 2: Define the App Component**\\n\\n```jsx\\nfunction App() {\\n  // State to store soccer data\\n  const [data, setData] = useState([]);\\n\\n  // Fetch data when the component mounts\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    fetchSoccerData();\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  // Function to fetch soccer data\\n  const fetchSoccerData = async () => {\\n    try {\\n      const response = await axios.get(\\"/api/soccer\\");\\n      setData(response.data);\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      console.error(\\"Error fetching soccer data:\\", error);\\n    }\\n  };\\n```\\n\\n- Defines the `App` functional component using the arrow function syntax.\\n- Uses the `useState` hook to create a state variable named `data`, initialized as an empty array.\\n- Uses the `useEffect` hook to run the `fetchSoccerData` function when the component mounts (similar to `componentDidMount` in class components).\\n- Defines the `fetchSoccerData` function, which makes an HTTP GET request to the `/api/soccer` endpoint using `axios`.\\n- If the request is successful, updates the `data` state with the fetched soccer data.\\n- If there\'s an error, logs an error message to the console.\\n\\n**Step 3: Render the UI**\\n\\n```jsx\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\"container mt-5\\">\\n      <h1 className=\\"mb-4\\">USA Soccer Team Data</h1>\\n      <div className=\\"row\\">\\n        {data.map((record, index) => (\\n          <div key={index} className=\\"col-md-4 mb-4\\">\\n            <div className=\\"card\\">\\n              <div className=\\"card-body\\">\\n                <h5 className=\\"card-title\\">{record.team}</h5>\\n                <p className=\\"card-text\\">{record.city}, {record.state}</p>\\n                <p className=\\"card-text\\">Stadium: {record.stadium}</p>\\n                <a href={record.wikipedia_url} className=\\"btn btn-primary\\">\\n                  Wikipedia\\n                </a>\\n              </div>\\n            </div>\\n          </div>\\n        ))}\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- Returns the JSX that defines the user interface of the component.\\n- The UI consists of a container with a title and a row of soccer team cards.\\n- Maps over the `data` array using the `map` function to create a card for each soccer team record.\\n- The `key` attribute is set to the index for efficient rendering.\\n- Displays the team name, city, state, stadium name, and a Wikipedia link for each record.\\n- Styling classes from the Bootstrap framework are used for formatting.\\n\\n**Step 4: Export the Component**\\n\\n```jsx\\nexport default App;\\n```\\n\\n- Exports the `App` component to make it available for other parts of your application.\\n\\nThis React component fetches soccer team data from the `/api/soccer` endpoint using `axios`, stores it in the `data` state, and renders the data as cards with information about each soccer team. The component takes advantage of React hooks for state management and side effects, making it a concise and effective way to handle data fetching and rendering in your app.\\n\\n### Part 3: Running the Application\\n\\n**Step 1: Run the Backend**\\n\\nIn a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `process_soccer_data.py` script and run it:\\n\\n```bash\\npython process_soccer_data.py\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Run the React Frontend**\\n\\nIn a new terminal window, navigate to the `soccer-visualization` directory and start the React app:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd soccer-visualization\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\nYour full-stack soccer team data visualization app should now be running! Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action. You should see cards displaying team information, and you can click on the Wikipedia link to access more details."},{"id":"react-python-flask-mongo-todo-app","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/react-python-flask-mongo-todo-app","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-24-react-python-mongo-todo-app.md","title":"Build a Todos React App using Python Flask Rest API and MongoDB Database","description":"In this tutorial, we will build a full-stack TODOs management application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete todos.

[Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, and npm is a package manager for Node.js.\\n2. [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a versatile programming language.\\n3. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/installation/): Flask is a micro web framework for Python.\\n\\n### Part 1: Setting Up the React Frontend\\n\\n**Step 1: Create a New React App**\\n\\nOpen your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-react-app todo-app\\ncd todo-app\\n```\\n\\nRun the following command to install Axios using npm:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install axios\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Create the TodoList Component**\\n\\nInside the `src` directory, create a new folder named `components`. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `TodoList.js`.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// src/components/TodoList.js\\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \'react\';\\n\\nconst TodoList = () => {\\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\\n  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState(\'\');\\n\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    fetch(\'/api/todos\')\\n      .then(response => response.json())\\n      .then(data => setTodos(data))\\n      .catch(error => console.error(\'Error fetching todos:\', error));\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  const handleCreate = () => {\\n    if (newTodo.trim() === \'\') return;\\n    fetch(\'/api/todos\', {\\n      method: \'POST\',\\n      headers: {\\n        \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\',\\n      },\\n      body: JSON.stringify({ title: newTodo }),\\n    })\\n      .then(response => response.json())\\n      .then(data => {\\n        setTodos([...todos, data]);\\n        setNewTodo(\'\');\\n      })\\n      .catch(error => console.error(\'Error creating todo:\', error));\\n  };\\n\\n  // Add functions for update and delete operations\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <h2>Todo List</h2>\\n      <input\\n        type=\\"text\\"\\n        value={newTodo}\\n        onChange={event => setNewTodo(event.target.value)}\\n        placeholder=\\"Enter new todo\\"\\n      />\\n      <button onClick={handleCreate}>Add Todo</button>\\n      <ul>\\n        {todos.map(todo => (\\n          <li key={todo.id}>\\n            {todo.title}\\n            {/* Add buttons and handlers for update and delete */}\\n          </li>\\n        ))}\\n      </ul>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nexport default TodoList;\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3: Use the TodoList Component**\\n\\nOpen `src/App.js` and update it to use the `TodoList` component.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// src/App.js\\nimport React from \'react\';\\nimport \'./App.css\';\\nimport TodoList from \'./components/TodoList\';\\n\\nfunction App() {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\"App\\">\\n      <header className=\\"App-header\\">\\n        <TodoList />\\n      </header>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nexport default App;\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4: Start the React App**\\n\\nIn the terminal, start the React app using:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\nYour React app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.\\n\\n### Part 2: Setting Up the Python Flask Backend\\n\\n**Step 1: Create a New Flask App**\\n\\nCreate a new directory for your backend code and navigate to it in the terminal.\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir flask-backend\\ncd flask-backend\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment**\\n\\nCreate and activate a virtual environment:\\n\\n```bash\\npython3 -m venv venv\\nsource venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3: Install Flask**\\n\\nInstall Flask using pip:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install Flask\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4: Create the Backend App**\\n\\nCreate a file named `app.py` in your backend directory.\\n\\n```python\\n# app.py\\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\ntodos = [\\n    {\\"id\\": 1, \\"title\\": \\"Buy groceries\\"},\\n    {\\"id\\": 2, \\"title\\": \\"Do

Operations**\\n\\nAdd the CRUD routes and operations to the `app.py` file. \\n\\n```python\\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\ntodos = [\\n    {\\"id\\": 1, \\"title\\": \\"Buy groceries\\"},\\n    {\\"id\\": 2, \\"title\\": \\"Do laundry\\"},\\n]\\n\\nnext_id = len(todos) + 1\\n\\n# Get all todos\\n@app.route(\'/api/todos\', methods=[\'GET\'])\\ndef get_todos():\\n    return jsonify(todos)\\n\\n# Get a single todo by ID\\n@app.route(\'/api/todos/<int:todo_id>\', methods=[\'GET\'])\\ndef get_todo(todo_id):\\n    todo = next((t for t in todos if t[\'id\'] == todo_id), None)\\n    if todo:\\n        return jsonify(todo)\\n    return jsonify({\\"message\\": \\"Todo not found\\"}), 404\\n\\n# Create a new todo\\n@app.route(\'/api/todos\', methods=[\'POST\'])\\ndef create_todo():\\n    global next_id\\n    data = request.json\\n    new_todo = {\\"id\\": next_id, \\"title\\": data[\\"title\\"]}\\n    todos.append(new_todo)\\n    next_id += 1\\n    return jsonify(new_todo), 201\\n\\n# Update an existing todo\\n@app.route(\'/api/todos/<int:todo_id>\', methods=[\'PUT\'])\\ndef update_todo(todo_id):\\n    data = request.json\\n    todo = next((t for t in todos if t[\'id\'] == todo_id), None)\\n    if todo:\\n        todo[\'title\'] = data[\'title\']\\n        return jsonify(todo)\\n    return jsonify({\\"message\\": \\"Todo not found\\"}), 404\\n\\n# Delete a todo\\n@app.route(\'/api/todos/<int:todo_id>\', methods=[\'DELETE\'])\\ndef delete_todo(todo_id):\\n    global todos\\n    todos = [t for t in todos if t[\'id\'] != todo_id]\\n    return jsonify({\\"message\\": \\"Todo deleted\\"}), 200\\n\\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\\n    app.run(debug=True)\\n```\\n\\n### Part 3: Connecting Frontend and Backend\\n\\n**Step 1: Fetch Data from Backend**\\n\\nUpdate the `TodoList.js` component to fetch todos from the backend API and add other operations to update and delete todos.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// src/components/TodoList.js\\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \'react\';\\nimport axios from \'axios\';\\n\\nconst TodoList = () => {\\n    const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\\n    const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState(\'\');\\n    \\n    const API_ENDPOINT = \\"http://127.0.0.1:5000\\";\\n\\n    useEffect(() => {\\n        fetchTodos();\\n    }, []);\\n    // Add functions for update and delete operations\\n\\n    const fetchTodos = async () => {\\n        try {\\n            const response = await axios.get(API_ENDPOINT + \'/api/todos\');\\n            setTodos(response.data);\\n        } catch (error) {\\n            console.error(\'Error fetching todos:\', error);\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\n    const addTodo = async () => {\\n        try {\\n            const response = await axios.post(API_ENDPOINT + \'/api/todos\', { title: newTodo });\\n            setTodos([...todos, response.data]);\\n            setNewTodo(\'\');\\n        } catch (error) {\\n            console.error(\'Error adding todo:\', error);\\n        }\\n    };\\n\\n    const deleteTodo = async (id) => {\\n        try {\\n            await axios.delete(API_ENDPOINT + `/api/todos/${id}`);\\n            setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\\n        } catch (error) {\\n            console.error(\'Error deleting todo:\', error);\\n        }\\n    };\\n    return (\\n        <div>\\n            <h1>Todo App</h1>\\n            <div>\\n                <input\\n                    type=\\"text\\"\\n                    value={newTodo}\\n                    onChange={e => setNewTodo(e.target.value)}\\n                    placeholder=\\"Enter a new todo\\"\\n                />\\n                <button onClick={addTodo}>Add</button>\\n            </div>\\n            <ul>\\n                {todos.map(todo => (\\n                    <li key={todo.id}>\\n                        {todo.title}{\' \'}\\n                        <button onClick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)}>Delete</button>\\n                    </li>\\n                ))}\\n            </ul>\\n        </div>\\n    );\\n};\\n\\nexport default TodoList;\\n```\\nNote  - Update API_ENDPOINT to correct port if running Flask app on any other port than default 5000.\\n\\n**Step 2: Enable CORS**\\n\\nThe CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error occurs when a web application running at one origin (domain) tries to make a request to a server located at a different origin. By default, browsers enforce the same-origin policy, which restricts these cross-origin requests for security reasons. To resolve CORS errors, you need to configure your Flask backend to allow requests from your React frontend\'s domain.\\n\\nHere\'s how you can resolve CORS errors in a Flask backend:\\n\\n1. Install the `Flask-CORS` extension:\\n\\nIf you haven\'t already installed `Flask-CORS`, you need to do so using the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd flask-backend\\npip install Flask-CORS\\n```\\n\\n2. Import and use `CORS` in your Flask app:\\n\\nIn your Flask `app.py` file, import and use the `CORS` extension to enable cross-origin requests from your React frontend. You need to specify the `origins` parameter to allow requests from your frontend\'s domain.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\\nfrom flask_cors import CORS\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\nCORS(app, origins=\\"http://localhost:3000\\")  # Replace with your React app\'s URL\\n\\n# ... (other routes and code)\\n```\\n\\nReplace `\\"http://localhost:3000\\"` with the actual URL of your React frontend. This configuration will allow requests from your React app\'s domain.\\n\\n3. Enable CORS for specific routes:\\n\\nYou can also enable CORS for specific routes if needed. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nCORS(app, resources={r\\"/api/*\\": {\\"origins\\": \\"http://localhost:3000\\"}})\\n```\\n\\nThis would enable CORS only for routes under `/api/`.\\n\\n4. Restart your Flask server:\\n\\nAfter making these changes, restart your Flask server so that the CORS configuration takes effect.\\n\\nWith these steps, your Flask backend should allow cross-origin requests from your React frontend, and you should no longer encounter CORS errors. Remember that enabling CORS should be done with caution and consideration for security, and it\'s important to restrict allowed origins to only the domains that need access to your backend API.\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nYou\'ve built a Todo management application with CRUD operations using React for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend. This application allows users to create, read, and delete todos. Remember that this is a simplified example, and you can further enhance the application with error handling, validation, user authentication, and database integration.\\n\\n### Github Repo\\n:::info\\n  You can refer to and clone the code samples for this tutorial from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/certifysphere/python-code-samples).\\n\\n  To clone the repository, you can use the following command:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  git clone https://github.com/certifysphere/python-code-samples.git\\n  ```\\n\\n  You can then navigate to the `/src/todo-react-python` directory to access all the code samples given in this tutorial. \\n:::"},{"id":"enabling-cors-in-an-express-node.js-app","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/enabling-cors-in-an-express-node.js-app","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-23-enable-cors-in-expressjs.md","title":"Enabling CORS in an Express Node.js app","description":"CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain (origin) than the one the page was served from.

It is a fundamental part of the `Same-Origin Policy`, which is designed to prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive data from other websites.\\n\\nThe Same-Origin Policy applies to requests made using XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch API in JavaScript. When a web page tries to make a cross-origin request, the browser blocks the request by default. However, there are legitimate use cases where cross-origin requests are necessary, such as when a frontend application needs to access data from an API hosted on a different domain.\\n\\nIn such cases, you need to enable CORS on the server-side to allow cross-origin requests. Enabling CORS involves adding specific HTTP headers to the server\'s response, which inform the browser that the server allows requests from specific origins.\\n\\nHere\'s why you might need to enable CORS:\\n\\n1. Frontend-Backend Separation: When your frontend application is running on a different domain or port than your backend API, you need to enable CORS to allow communication between them.\\n\\n2. API Access from Different Origins: If you want to make your API publicly accessible and allow other domains or applications to consume its data, you need to enable CORS to authorize cross-origin requests.\\n\\nBest practices for enabling CORS in a production environment:\\n\\n1. **Restrict Allowed Origins**: Only allow specific origins (domains) that you trust to access your API. Avoid using the wildcard (`*`) in the [Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header, as it allows any domain to access your API, potentially exposing sensitive data.\\n\\n2. **Use Specific Methods**: Explicitly specify the allowed HTTP methods in the [Access-Control-Allow-Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods) header. Limiting the methods to those required by your API reduces the risk of unauthorized actions.\\n\\n3. **Handle Preflight Requests**: For complex requests (e.g., those that use custom headers or methods other than GET, POST, or HEAD), the browser sends a preflight OPTIONS request to check if the server supports CORS. Make sure your server responds to these preflight requests with the appropriate headers.\\n\\n4. **Secure Cookies**: If your API uses cookies for authentication or session management, set the [Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) header to `true`. However, be cautious when allowing credentials with cross-origin requests, as it can pose security risks.\\n\\nHere\'s an example of enabling CORS in an Express Node.js app using the `cors` middleware:\\n\\nFirst, you\'ll need to install the `cors` package:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install cors\\n```\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require(\'express\');\\nconst cors = require(\'cors\');\\n\\nconst app = express();\\n\\n// Enable CORS for all routes\\napp.use(cors());\\n\\n// Or enable CORS for specific routes\\n// app.get(\'/api/data\', cors(), (req, res) => { ... });\\n\\n// Your other route handlers here...\\n\\nconst port = 3000;\\napp.listen(port, () => {\\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nBy adding `app.use(cors())`, you are enabling CORS for all routes in your Express app. This will allow requests from any domain to access your backend API.\\n\\nYou can also use it selectively for specific routes, as shown in the commented line. \\nIf you want to restrict CORS to specific origins, you can pass an options object to the `cors` middleware. For example, to allow requests from `http://example.com` and `http://localhost:3000`, you can use the following code:\\n\\n```javascript\\napp.use(cors({\\n  origin: [\'http://example.com\', \'http://localhost:3000\'],\\n}));\\n```\\n\\nThis way, requests from other domains will be blocked, and only requests from the specified origins will be allowed.\\n\\nThe middleware will add the necessary CORS headers to the server\'s response, allowing cross-origin requests from any domain by default. To restrict the allowed origins, you can pass an options object to the `cors()` function with a `origin` property specifying the allowed origins."},{"id":"dotenv-files-nodejs-expressjs","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dotenv-files-nodejs-expressjs","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-21-dotenv-file-nodejs.md","title":"dotEnv(.env) files in Express Node.js app","description":"Creating a .env file is a common practice in Node.js projects to store environment-specific configuration variables.

These variables are typically sensitive data or settings that may change depending on the environment where the application is running, such as development, testing, staging, or production.\\n\\nThe `.env` file should not be committed to version control systems like Git, as it may contain sensitive information. Instead, it is usually added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.\\n\\nHere\'s how you can set up different files for different environments:\\n\\n1. Create a `.env` file: This file will contain default values for your environment variables that are common across all environments.\\n\\n2. Create `.env.local`, `.env.dev`, `.env.staging`, and `.env.prod`: These files will contain environment-specific variables for local development, development environment, staging environment, and production environment, respectively.\\n\\n3. Load environment-specific variables based on the running environment: Your application will read the appropriate `.env` file depending on the environment it is running in. For example, when running locally for development, it will use `.env.local`, and when deployed to production, it will use `.env.prod`.\\n\\nHere\'s an example of the content of these files:\\n\\n`.env` (Default variables):\\n```\\nPORT=3002\\nDB_HOST=localhost\\nDB_PORT=5432\\nDB_NAME=myappdb\\nDB_USER=myappuser\\nDB_PASSWORD=mypassword\\n```\\n\\n`.env.local` (Local development variables):\\n```\\nDB_HOST=localhost\\nDB_PORT=5432\\nDB_NAME=myappdb_dev\\nDB_USER=myappuser_dev\\nDB_PASSWORD=mydevpassword\\n```\\n\\n`.env.dev` (Development environment variables):\\n```\\nDB_HOST=dev-db-host\\nDB_PORT=5432\\nDB_NAME=myappdb_dev\\nDB_USER=myappuser_dev\\nDB_PASSWORD=mydevpassword\\n```\\n\\n`.env.staging` (Staging environment variables):\\n```\\nDB_HOST=staging-db-host\\nDB_PORT=5432\\nDB_NAME=myappdb_staging\\nDB_USER=myappuser_staging\\nDB_PASSWORD=mystagingpassword\\n```\\n\\n`.env.prod` (Production environment variables):\\n```\\nDB_HOST=prod-db-host\\nDB_PORT=5432\\nDB_NAME=myappdb_prod\\nDB_USER=myappuser_prod\\nDB_PASSWORD=myprodpassword\\n```\\n\\nIn your Node.js/Express app, you can use a package like `dotenv` to read these environment variables and use them in your code. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst dotenv = require(\'dotenv\');\\ndotenv.config();\\n\\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3002;\\nconst dbHost = process.env.DB_HOST;\\nconst dbPort = process.env.DB_PORT;\\nconst dbName = process.env.DB_NAME;\\nconst dbUser = process.env.DB_USER;\\nconst dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;\\n\\n// Use these variables in your application code...\\n```\\n\\nBy setting up your environment variables in this way, you can easily switch between different environments without modifying your code, making it easier to manage configurations for various deployment scenarios."},{"id":"mdx-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mdx-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","title":"MDX Blog Post","description":"Blog posts support Docusaurus Markdown features, such as MDX.","date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.22,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer","url":"https://sebastienlorber.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/slorber.png","key":"slorber","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mdx-blog-post","title":"MDX Blog Post","authors":["slorber"],"tags":["docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"dotEnv(.env) files in Express Node.js app","permalink":"/blog/dotenv-files-nodejs-expressjs"}},"content":"Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nUse the power of React to create interactive blog posts.\\n\\n```js\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n```\\n\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n\\n:::"}]}}')}}]);
